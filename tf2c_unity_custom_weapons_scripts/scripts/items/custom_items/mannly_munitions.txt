// Hello! This is Mannly Munitions but modified by Roon for alternative Live TF2 experience.
// Most rebalance ideas has been brought from New-Old Weapons Pack! by SilentFox3, and https://www.bmod.tf/moddedweapons/, and I only implemented some of the changes.
// I will try not to change weapons excessively while retaining original TF2 gameplay experience.
// Have fun!
