# Unity Custom Weapons
Unity Custom Weapons is the spiritual successor of Fusion Custom Weapon which merges custom weapons mods found on internet. It is designed to be better replacement of Knockout Custom Weapons. It uses __zero__ server plugins, unlike some of other custom weapons. Most contents are intact with original sources, however some weapons from Mombae's Fun Pack are disabled due to duplicated weapons.
