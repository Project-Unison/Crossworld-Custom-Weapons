# Crossworld Custom Weapons
Crossworld Custom Weapons is the spiritual successor of Fusion Custom Weapon which merges some of custom weapons mods found on internet. It is designed to be better replacement of Knockout Custom Weapons. It uses __zero__ server plugins, unlike some of other custom weapons. Most contents are intact with original sources, however some weapons are disabled due to duplicated weapons, or resulting overpowered performance.
